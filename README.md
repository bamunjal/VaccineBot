# VaccineBot
A bot that will keep checking for availability of vaccine for a locality and ping when available

Update your districtId and age limit you want to be notified for in _constants.js_ and run the scheduler with your choice of interval to get updates on vaccine availability.

I'm adding the status to a file every 15 minutes and reading it from a python code which updates my Raspberry Pi's LCD screen (Just for fun :))
Feel free to update the code to get notification in any form you want.

Note : The code was writtern in 2 hours, so excuse any shortcuts taken.
Cheers !
